            <li><strong>Third Party Software.</strong> The Service may include or incorporate third party software components that are generally available free of charge under licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy, modify, and distribute those components (“Third Party Components”). Although the Service is provided to you subject to these Terms, nothing in these Terms prevents, restricts, or is intended to prevent or restrict you from obtaining Third Party Components under the applicable third party licenses or to limit your use of Third Party Components under those third party licenses.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>User Content Generally.</strong> Certain features of the Service may permit users to upload content to the Service, including messages, photos, video, images, folders, data, text, and other types of works (“User Content”) and to publish User Content on the Service.

You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of providing User Content via the Service. By providing User Content via the Service, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:
              <ol type=\\"a\\">
                <li>you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize Cohart and users of the Service to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this Section, in the manner contemplated by Cohart, the Service, and these Terms;</li>
                <li>your User Content, and the use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause Cohart to violate any law or regulation; and</li>
                <li>your User Content could not be deemed by a reasonable person to be objectionable, profane, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>User Content Disclaimer.</strong> We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content.

          </li>
          <li><strong>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Generally.</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Cohart in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 16.2 and 17.3, you and Cohart agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND COHART ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Exceptions.</strong> Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Opt-Out.</strong> If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 16 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Cohart, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 305 South Street, Sausalito, CA, 94965 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once Cohart receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 16 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 17.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Arbitrator.</strong> Any arbitration between you and Cohart will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Cohart. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Notice of Arbitration;</strong> Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Cohart’s address for Notice is: Cohart, Inc., 305 South Street, Sausalito, CA, 94965. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Cohart may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Cohart must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Cohart in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Cohart will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Fees.</strong> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Cohart will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Marin County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Cohart for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND COHART AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Cohart agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</strong> If Cohart makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Cohart’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Cohart’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Cohart will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Enforceability.</strong> If Section 16.7 or the entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, or if Cohart receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 16 will be null and void and, in that case, exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</strong></li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>General Terms.</strong> These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Cohart regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</li>
              <li><strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Cohart submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Marin County, California for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. We operate the Service from our offices in California, and we make no representation that Materials included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</li>
              <li><strong>Privacy Policy.</strong> Please read the Cohart Privacy Policy [link to privacy policy] carefully for information relating to our collection, use, storage, disclosure of your personal information.
