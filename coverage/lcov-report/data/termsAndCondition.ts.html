&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information We Collect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When we send you emails, we may track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer experience and improve our Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Snapshots, Images, and Videos. You may choose to upload images, videos, and other Snapshots, for instance relating to your artistic works.&lt;/p&gt;

&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;How We Use the Information We Collect&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;We use the information we collect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To provide, maintain, improve, and enhance our Services;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To personalize your experience on our Services such as by providing tailored content and recommendations;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To understand and analyze how you use our Services and develop new products, services, features, and functionality;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To communicate with you, provide you with updates and other information relating to our Services, provide information that you request, respond to comments and questions, and otherwise provide customer support;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For marketing and advertising purposes, such as developing and providing promotional and advertising materials that may be relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To send you text messages and push notifications;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To find and prevent fraud, and respond to trust and safety issues that may arise;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For compliance purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service or other legal rights, or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency; and&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time the information is collected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How We Share the Information We Collect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affiliates&lt;/strong&gt;. We may share any information we receive with our affiliates for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendors and Service Providers&lt;/strong&gt;. We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers retained in connection with the provision of our Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Content&lt;/strong&gt;. Our Services are social services in which you can find, enjoy, and share content. Your name, user name, and other profile information will always be viewable and searchable by other users. The content you post to the Services will be displayed on the Services and viewable by other users. You may also engage in private chats with other users. We are not responsible for the other users’ use of available information, so you should carefully consider whether and what to post or how you identify yourself on the Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing&lt;/strong&gt;. We do not rent, sell, or share information about you with nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes, unless we have your permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics Partners&lt;/strong&gt;. We use analytics services such as Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. You can learn more about Google’s practices by visiting &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/"&gt;https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/&lt;/a&gt;.

&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures&lt;/strong&gt;. We may access, preserve, and disclose your information if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (b) respond to your requests; or (c) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety. For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of your information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or through the Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers&lt;/strong&gt;. We may transfer your information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets. The use of your information following any of these events will be governed by the provisions of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time the applicable information was collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consent&lt;/strong&gt;. We may also disclose your information with your permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing Communications&lt;/strong&gt;. You can unsubscribe from our promotional emails via the link provided in the emails. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us.&lt;/p&gt;

Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on these third party services or any information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;We make reasonable efforts to protect your information by using physical and electronic safeguards designed to improve the security of the information we maintain. However, as no electronic transmission or storage of information can be entirely secure, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children’s Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under 13 years of age, and no part of our Services are directed to children. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then you may alert us at &lt;a href="mailto:dev@cohart.co"&gt;dev@cohart.co&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Visitors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Our Services are hosted in the United States and intended for visitors located within the United States. If you choose to use the Services from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services. By providing any information, including personal information, on or to the Services, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes to this Privacy Policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;We will post any adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this page, and the revised version will be effective when it is posted. If we materially change the ways in which we use or share personal information previously collected from you through the Services, we will notify you through the Services, by email, or other communication.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Last Updated: 3/9/2021&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Cohart, Inc. (“&lt;strong&gt;Cohart&lt;/strong&gt;,” “&lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt;,” or “&lt;strong&gt;us&lt;/strong&gt;”) and our website at cohart.co, along with our related websites, networks, applications, mobile applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, the “&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt;”). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and Cohart regarding your use of the Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE&lt;/strong&gt;, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING COHART’S PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THESE “&lt;strong&gt;TERMS&lt;/strong&gt;”). IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE, OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE OUR PERMISSION TO USE THE SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND COHART’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY COHART AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARBITRATION NOTICE.&lt;/strong&gt; Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 16, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND COHART ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. (See Section 16.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cohart Service Overview.&lt;/strong&gt; Cohart provides the Service to facilitate connections in the art community. Users may create their own profiles, view profiles of other users to select matches, and communicate with other users they have matched with.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eligibility.&lt;/strong&gt; You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounts and Registration.&lt;/strong&gt; To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at hello@cohart.co.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Licenses&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited License.&lt;/strong&gt; Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Cohart grants you, solely for your personal, non-commercial use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to: (a) install and use one object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Service obtained from a legitimate marketplace (whether installed by you or pre-installed on your mobile device by the device manufacturer) on a mobile device that you own or control; and (b) access and use the Service.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;License Restrictions.&lt;/strong&gt; Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may not: (a) reproduce, distribute, publicly display, or publicly perform the Service; (b) make modifications to the Service; or (c) interfere with or circumvent any feature of the Service, including any security or access control mechanism. If you are prohibited under applicable law from using the Service, you may not use it.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; If you choose to provide input and suggestions regarding problems with or proposed modifications or improvements to the Service (“Feedback”), then you hereby grant Cohart an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, including to improve the Service and create other products and services.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership; Proprietary Rights.&lt;/strong&gt; The Service is owned and operated by Cohart. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Service (“Materials”) provided by Cohart are protected by intellectual property and other laws. All Materials included in the Service are the property of Cohart or its third party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by Cohart, you may not make use of the Materials.

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Party Terms&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Party Services and Linked Websites.&lt;/strong&gt; Cohart may provide tools through the Service that enable you to export information, including User Content, to third party services, including through features that allow you to link your account on Cohart with an account on the third party service, such as Twitter or Facebook, or through our implementation of third party buttons (such as “like” or “share” buttons). By using one of these tools, you agree that Cohart may transfer that information to the applicable third party service. Third party services are not under Cohart’s control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Cohart is not responsible for any third party service’s use of your exported information. The Service may also contain links to third party websites. Linked websites are not under Cohart’s control, and Cohart is not responsible for their content.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Party Software.&lt;/strong&gt; The Service may include or incorporate third party software components that are generally available free of charge under licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy, modify, and distribute those components (“Third Party Components”). Although the Service is provided to you subject to these Terms, nothing in these Terms prevents, restricts, or is intended to prevent or restrict you from obtaining Third Party Components under the applicable third party licenses or to limit your use of Third Party Components under those third party licenses.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Content&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Content Generally.&lt;/strong&gt; Certain features of the Service may permit users to upload content to the Service, including messages, photos, video, images, folders, data, text, and other types of works (“User Content”) and to publish User Content on the Service. You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content that you post to the Service.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited License Grant to Cohart.&lt;/strong&gt; By providing User Content to or via the Service, you grant Cohart a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels now known or hereafter developed.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited License Grant to Other Users.&lt;/strong&gt; By providing User Content to or via the Service to other users of the Service, you grant those users a non-exclusive license to access and use that User Content as permitted by these Terms and the functionality of the Service.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Content Representations and Warranties.&lt;/strong&gt; Cohart disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of providing User Content via the Service. By providing User Content via the Service, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:
              &lt;ol type="a"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize Cohart and users of the Service to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this Section, in the manner contemplated by Cohart, the Service, and these Terms;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;your User Content, and the use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause Cohart to violate any law or regulation; and&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;your User Content could not be deemed by a reasonable person to be objectionable, profane, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Content Disclaimer.&lt;/strong&gt; We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. Cohart may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that when using the Service you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Cohart with respect to User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, Cohart does not permit copyright-infringing activities on the Service.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Content.&lt;/strong&gt; Cohart does not control and does not have any obligation to monitor: (a) User Content; (b) any content made available by third parties; or (c) the use of the Service by its users. You acknowledge and agree that Cohart reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Service for operational and other purposes. If at any time Cohart chooses to monitor the content, Cohart still assumes no responsibility or liability for content or any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of content. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;

You can turn off notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “settings” page.&lt;/li&gt;

              &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modification of these Terms.&lt;/strong&gt; We reserve the right to change these Terms on a going-forward basis at any time. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, we may require that you accept the modified Terms in order to continue to use the Service. Material modifications are effective upon your acceptance of the modified Terms. Immaterial modifications are effective upon publication. Except as expressly permitted in this Section 11, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties to these Terms. Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the version of these Terms that was in effect at the time the dispute arose.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term, Termination and Modification of the Service&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term.&lt;/strong&gt; These Terms are effective beginning when you accept the Terms or first download, install, access, or use the Service, and ending when terminated as described in Section 12.2.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination.&lt;/strong&gt; If you violate any provision of these Terms, your authorization to access the Service and these Terms automatically terminate. In addition, Cohart may, at its sole discretion, terminate these Terms or your account on the Service, or suspend or terminate your access to the Service, at any time for any reason or no reason, with or without notice. You may terminate your account and these Terms at any time by contacting customer service at hello@cohart.co.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect of Termination.&lt;/strong&gt; Upon termination of these Terms: (a) your license rights will terminate and you must immediately cease all use of the Service; (b) you will no longer be authorized to access your account or the Service; (c) you must pay Cohart any unpaid amount that was due prior to termination; and (d) all payment obligations accrued prior to termination and Sections 4.3, 5, 12.3, 14, 15, 16, and 17 will survive&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modification of the Service.&lt;/strong&gt; Cohart reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service at any time (including by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Service), temporarily or permanently, without notice to you. Cohart will have no liability for any change to the Service or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Service.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indemnity.&lt;/strong&gt; To the fullest extent permitted by law, you are responsible for your use of the Service, and you will defend and indemnify Cohart and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (together, the “&lt;strong&gt;Cohart Entities&lt;/strong&gt;”) from and against every claim brought by a third party, and any related liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or connected with: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Service; (b) your violation of any portion of these Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation; (c) your violation of any third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or (d) any dispute or issue between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimers; No Warranties&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. COHART DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. COHART DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND COHART DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR COHART ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE COHART ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Cohart does not disclaim any warranty or other right that Cohart is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitation of Liability&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COHART ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY COHART ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 16.5 AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE COHART ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO COHART FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO CLAIM; OR (B) $100.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 16 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Resolution and Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generally.&lt;/strong&gt; In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Cohart in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 16.2 and 17.3, you and Cohart agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND COHART ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opt-Out.&lt;/strong&gt; If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 16 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Cohart, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 305 South Street, Sausalito, CA, 94965 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once Cohart receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 16 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 17.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitrator.&lt;/strong&gt; Any arbitration between you and Cohart will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Cohart. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice of Arbitration;&lt;/strong&gt; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Cohart’s address for Notice is: Cohart, Inc., 305 South Street, Sausalito, CA, 94965. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Cohart may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Cohart must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Cohart in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Cohart will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fees.&lt;/strong&gt; If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Cohart will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Marin County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Cohart for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Class Actions.&lt;/strong&gt; YOU AND COHART AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Cohart agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.&lt;/strong&gt; If Cohart makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Cohart’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Cohart’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Cohart will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforceability.&lt;/strong&gt; If Section 16.7 or the entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, or if Cohart receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 16 will be null and void and, in that case, exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Terms.&lt;/strong&gt; These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Cohart regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
